Problem: Valid Parenthesis String

Problem Statement:
You are given a string s containing three types of characters:
- '('
- ')'
- '*'

The '*' character can be treated as:
- '('
- ')'
- An empty string

Task:
Return true if the string can be a valid parenthesis string.
Otherwise, return false.

Approach:
- Use recursion with two parameters:
    - Current index
    - Current count of open brackets
- If count becomes negative → invalid.
- If end of string is reached → valid only if count is 0.
- Use a 2D DP array to memoize results:
    - dp[index][openCount]
- For '*', try all three possibilities:
    - Treat as '('
    - Treat as ')'
    - Treat as empty

Algorithm Used:
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming (Top-Down / Memoization)

Time Complexity:
- O(N²)

Space Complexity:
- O(N²)
