Problem: Jump Game II

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array nums.

Each element nums[i] represents your maximum jump length at that position.

You are initially positioned at index 0.

Task:
Return the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index.
It is guaranteed that you can reach the last index.

Approach:
- Use recursion to explore all possible jumps from each index.
- Use memoization (DP array) to store results of previously computed indices.
- From each index:
    - Try all possible jumps (1 to nums[i]).
    - Take the minimum number of jumps among all options.
- Store and reuse results to avoid recomputation.

Algorithm Used:
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming (Top-Down / Memoization)

Time Complexity:
- O(N²) (worst case)

Space Complexity:
- O(N) (DP array + recursion stack)
