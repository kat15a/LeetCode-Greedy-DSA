Problem: Jump Game

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array nums.

Each element nums[i] represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Initially, you are positioned at index 0.

Task:
Return true if you can reach the last index.
Otherwise, return false.

Approach:
- Maintain a variable maxReach to track the farthest reachable index.
- Traverse the array:
    - If the current index is greater than maxReach, return false.
    - Update maxReach as max(maxReach, i + nums[i]).
- If traversal completes, return true.

Algorithm Used:
- Greedy Strategy

Time Complexity:
- O(N)

Space Complexity:
- O(1)
