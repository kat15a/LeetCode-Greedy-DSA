Problem: Assign Cookies

Problem Statement:
You are given two integer arrays g and s.

- g[i] represents the greed factor of the ith child.
- s[j] represents the size of the jth cookie.

Each child can receive at most one cookie.
A child will be content if the size of the cookie is greater than or equal to their greed factor.

Task:
Return the maximum number of children that can be content.

Approach:
- Sort both arrays.
- Use two pointers to iterate through children and cookies.
- Assign the smallest possible cookie that satisfies a child.
- Move pointers accordingly.

Algorithm Used:
- Sorting
- Two Pointer Technique
- Greedy Strategy

Time Complexity:
- O(N log N + M log M)

Space Complexity:
- O(1)
