Problem: Lemonade Change

Problem Statement:
At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5.

Customers are standing in a queue and pay using:
- $5
- $10
- $20 bills

You must provide correct change to each customer.

Initially, you have no change.

Task:
Return true if you can provide change to every customer.
Otherwise, return false.

Approach:
- Maintain counters for $5 and $10 bills.
- For each customer:
  - If bill is $5 → increase five count.
  - If bill is $10 → give one $5 as change.
  - If bill is $20:
      - Prefer giving one $10 and one $5.
      - Otherwise give three $5 bills.
      - If not possible, return false.

Algorithm Used:
- Greedy Strategy
- Simulation

Time Complexity:
- O(N)

Space Complexity:
- O(1)
